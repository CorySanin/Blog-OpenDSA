This blog is for documenting my progress contributing to the OpenDSA project. My main objective is adding interactive content on parameter passing to the Programming Languages book. This includes adding a visualization of each parameter-passing method and adding a proficiency exercise for each parameter passing method.

This project is being supervised by [Thomas Naps](https://github.com/tomnaps).
