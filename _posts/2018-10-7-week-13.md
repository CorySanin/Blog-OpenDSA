## Fixing an exercise

*10-7-2018*

The reason things weren't displaying correctly was I forgot to create
`paramPassingByValPRO.json`. So I created it.

## Next exercise

*10-8-2018*

I'm moving on to the by reference proficiency exercise. Right off the bat I'm
having trouble with JSAV. In order to reset the exercise, all JSAV elements
need to be cleared. Thankfully, most JSAV objects have a `clear` method. Most.
Pointers can't be cleared this way. The label part of the pointer gets cleared.
But the actual pointer part, the arrow, doesn't get cleared. Without performing
any extra steps, resetting the exercise multiple times will result in a mess
like this:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2018-10-8-pointer-clear-method.png" alt="JSAV pointers can't be cleared" />

If I call `pointer.hide()` before `pointer.clear()`, then the arrow is also
removed from the canvas. I just hope that this approach doesn't cause extra
JSAV objects to get skipped by the garbage collector.

It took some noodling to get this exercise to work. JSAV really puts the burden
of setting up an identical starting point for the exercise on the developer. In
the by value exercise, this wasn't too bad since the original arrays were stored
in their own variables and could be simply passed along. With pointers, however,
I needed to pass along the necessary information to create a new pointer. That
is, I needed enough information to know what the pointer in question was
pointing to. I ended up just passing a string that said the scope and name of
the thing it's supposed to point to. It's not pretty.
