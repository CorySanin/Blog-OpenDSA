## Copy-Restore Exercise

*11-4-2018*

I finished copy-restore's proficiency exercise. Not much to say, it was really
straightforward. I started with the by reference exercise and added some of the
code from by value and viola. It was really that simple. The only tricky thing
was figure out how to grade the whole restore part of copy-restore. I ended up
counting how many steps there were and using that to
[determine when an answer needs to be graded](https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA/commit/b8540c98b8508dd54fdad7e53170da549250cc95#diff-f7e2f911138242e5a57c5273eab06d9eR55).
This way, the two values can be restored in either order. If that makes sense.

[Here](https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA/commit/b8540c98b8508dd54fdad7e53170da549250cc95)
is my commit.
