## By Name Exercise

*12-24-2018*

I finished the by name proficiency exercise. I took the by reference exercise
and added a tiny bit to make it function by-name. It was fairly simple, except
I accidentally used `av.ds.array` instead of `modeljsavAV.ds.array` in the model
solution, which caused issues. That's just careless copy-and-pasting. Anyway, I
believe it's done! Since I finished the main part of this project, all that's
left is to go back and polish some things. The end is in sight!

[Here](https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA/commit/94ce1f861385d6764eb1509354ddb7678f79df13)
is my commit.
