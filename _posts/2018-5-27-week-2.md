## Making a book

*6-1-2018*

Today I dug into OpenDSA to figure out how it works and what files are used when
`make bookname` is executed. There are four main directories
(that I'm aware of):

* config
* AV
* Exercises
* RST

the config folder contains a json file for each book that can be built. A book's
configuration file contains metadata about the book, as well as all the chapters
and what the chapters are called internally. This, in turn, is used to locate
the relevant RST file from the RST directory. The RST file contains chapter
content, as well as references to excercises and other visualizations.
