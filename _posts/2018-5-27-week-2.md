## Making a book

*6-1-2018*

Today I dug into OpenDSA to figure out how it works and what files are used when
`make bookname` is executed. There are four main directories
(that I'm aware of):

* config
* AV
* Exercises
* RST

the config folder contains a json file for each book that can be built. A book's
configuration file contains metadata about the book, as well as all the chapters
and what the chapters are called internally. This, in turn, is used to locate
the relevant RST file from the RST directory. The RST file contains chapter
content, as well as references to excercises and other visualizations.

JSAV is used for creating many of the visualizations, or that's the end-goal.
One problem; JSAV's documentation is... not great. For example, the keyValuePair
API documentation is missing entirely. But the keyValuePair API doesn't appear
to be available in the version of JSAV used by OpenDSA anyhow. While I could
choose to use a more recent version, I'm instead going to try to create the
visualization using the current version of JSAV. If I could see a preview of
what it looks like to use the keyValuePair API, I'd know beforehand if it's
something I'd be willing to go through the trouble of trying to use. But since
the documentation contains very few graphics or interactive examples, I'm not
going to bother.

I saw the same basic functionality I was looking for in the data structures
book. For some of the slideshows demonstrating array-based queues, labels are
used to hold the value of a single primitive variable. I believe this will make
the most sense in creating visualizations of the different parameter passing
methods.
