## Making an exercise

*9-13-2018*

It's been difficult juggling my internship, school, and this project all at
once, but I'm so great that I'm able to pull it off. This week I've been
exploring JSAV proficiency exercises. Today I made some progress converting
the byval slideshow into an exercise. So far I have a working initialize
function. I also wrote the function that executes when clicking on an array
element.

Initially, I thought I wrote that part incorrectly because it only
worked when clicking on class-level elements (not main or foo). Turns out the
rectangles I put around main and foo variables are the topmost element and they
prevents the user from clicking all elements beneath them. 🤦

Anyway, playing with the z-index of some of the elements fixed it. JSAV pls fix.

[Here](https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA/commit/559ebfb8cbaecf5eb6645e7c2a6197ffd6cea9df)
is my initial commit. Still a WIP.
