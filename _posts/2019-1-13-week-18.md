## Model Solutions

*1-17-2019*

Today I just spent some time making the model solutions for the by value and by
reference exercises look like how they look in the exercises. It's a little bit
tedious, but not awful.

Anyway,
[here](https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA/commit/6ec1f9d4a3ffa01ba0a5d16900ab54f75f20a0b6)
and
[here](https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA/commit/4af4e6e9fca83f01a31f657613cd40623cd1b52b)
are my commits.
