## Pull Request

*6-11-2018*

Now that I have access to the main repo, I pulled the changes from my fork into the main branch. The pull request can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA/pull/340).

I didn't do much else since I wasn't sure what changes I needed to make and I wanted to know before I continued. Namely, the slideshows are supposed to use randomly generated examples.

In the afternoon, I met with Dr. Naps to find out more about generating code for the slideshows. I have a better understanding of what I need to do so I can get back to work on the project. We also discus possible approaches to visualizing some of the other parameter passing methods.
