## Pull Request

*6-11-2018*

Now that I have access to the main repo, I pulled the changes from my fork into the main branch. The pull request can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA/pull/340).

I didn't do much else since I wasn't sure what changes I needed to make and I wanted to know before I continued. Namely, the slideshows are supposed to use randomly generated examples. It makes no sense to continue building static slideshows when a good portion of what I write will likely have to be rewritten.

In the afternoon, I met with Dr. Naps 

## Meeting

*6-11-2018*

Today I launched my project's blog using GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). This site's repository is available [here](https://github.com/CorySanin/Blog-OpenDSA).

Next week I hope to become familiar with visualizations and create a simple visualization.
