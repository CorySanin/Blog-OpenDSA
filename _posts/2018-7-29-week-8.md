## Minor Corrections to By Copy-Restore

*7-31-2018*

Dr. Naps pointed out a mistake I made for the text on one of the slides, so I
took care of that right away. He also suggested moving the pointer labels next
to their respective labels in the foo box. Here's what that looks like:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2018-7-31-pointer-label-positions.png" alt="moving jsav pointers..." />

It looks better, since it doesn't cover as much content and also does a better
job illustrating where values are coming from. But pulling this off with the
current version of JSAV is a total mess. Unlike most objects in JSAV, pointers
can't be positioned relative to arbitrary JSAV objects. Instead, they're
positioned relative to the target they're pointing at.

However, there is a trick
to position the label relative to something else. By setting `fixed` to `true`,
the pointer can first target an array to position the label relative to, then
re-target the pointer to the *actual* target. Since `fixed` is set to `true`,
the pointer label isn't repositioned after pointing back to the correct target.

This is what
[my code](https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA/blob/828346c94b561ca9a5aa086e25e6cc21fa74d5f8/AV/PL/paramPassingCopyRestore.js#L275)
basically looks like right now:

```
cprPointers[fooVarNames[i]] = av.pointer(fooVarNames[i],fooVars[fooVarNames[i]],{
  targetIndex: 0,
  fixed: true,
  left: (leftMargin * -1.75),
  top: 8,
  anchor: 'left center'
})
cprPointers[fooVarNames[i]].target(cprVars[fooVarNames[i]],{
  targetIndex: destIndex
})
```

Not ideal, but that's just the way it goes sometimes. JSAV pls fix.

Here's [my commit](https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA/commit/828346c94b561ca9a5aa086e25e6cc21fa74d5f8).
