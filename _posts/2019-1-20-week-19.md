## Model Solutions Part 2

*1-20-2019*

Tonight I finished all the remaining model solutions. That's it! It's all done!
It's been a pleasure getting to work with Dr. Thomas Naps one final time before
I graduated. I'd like to thank him for being such an amazing professor and I
wish him a happy retirement.

I'm also excited for my work to be used in upcoming PL classes at UW Oshkosh.
It's cool to have something to leave behind for future generations to use. And
it's done! I've put in so much work and I can finally stand back and appreciate
what I've created. It feels great.
