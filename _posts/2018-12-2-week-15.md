## Macro Exercise

*12-2-2018*

I finished the macro proficiency exercise. The hardest part of implementing this
exercise by far was finding the energy to sit down and do it. It didn't take all
that much work, but with my internship at Wildcard still going on and finals
approaching, I'm just getting exhausted. However, I **will** finish this project
before the year is up. I just have one more exercise. There's a couple minor
changes I still need to go back and do before I'm truly done but that'll be
relatively minor. Next up is the scary one: by name. ðŸ˜¬

[Here](https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA/commit/7b4bcda65cd317ea0710f2b0ce915c800cda6be5)
is my commit.
