## Making an exercise - continued

*9-16-2018*

The byval proficiency exercise is working! The overall presentation is still a
little rough around the edges, but the actual exercise does function correctly.
The model solution, for some reason, doesn't walk the user through the solution
yet, so I have yet to fix that. Also some of the standard buttons (help, about)
don't seem to be displaying correctly. Other than that it's looking pretty good!

[Here](https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA/commit/a1cc850f511ea6edc7e2310de9fb44b3ab34a4ef)
is my commit.
