## By Name

*8-19-2018*

By name was surprisingly easy. I used the by reference slideshow as a base and
edited it to move around the second pointer whenever the first one was altered.
I also repositioned the pointers in both by reference and by name to be farther
to the right, as to not cover up other labels.

All the slideshows are finally functional! All that's left is to make some
changes to by macro and then I'll be off to work on the proficiency exercises.

For by macro, I'm in the process of displaying what line from the original code
corresponds to which line of the executed code. With any luck, this will be done
by the end of the week.

Here's [my commit](https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA/commit/b95d21960232878583a78b1defb2bd347b08ecec).
